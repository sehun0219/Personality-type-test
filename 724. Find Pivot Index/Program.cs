//Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.

//The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly 
//to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

//If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0
//because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

//Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.
